5th release.

Revised 2014 March 9th (see notes)
revised 2014 June 22nd (see notes)

Compiled version () (pre-compiled coreboot.rom, flashrom/bucts source code. Documentation.):
 - useful if you just want to flash the new version:
 - http://libreboot.org/release/4/libreboot_bin.tar.gz

Source code () (coreboot, bucts, flashrom, grub2, memtest86+. Config files. Documentation.):
 - useful if you want to study and hack the source code:
 - http://libreboot.org/release/4/libreboot_src.tar.gz

(gluglug.org.uk/X60/release/4/X60_source.tar.gz and gluglug.org.uk/X60/release/4/X60_binary.tar.gz were the old links)

Binary archive now have 2 images:
 - With serial output enabled and memtest86+ included (debug level 8 in coreboot)
 - With serial output disabled and memtest86+ excluded (faster boot speeds) (debugging disabled)

Reduced impact on battery life:
 - "processor.max_cstate=2" instead of "idle=halt" for booting default kernel

coreboot.rom (faster boot speeds, debugging disabled):
 - Disabled coreboot serial output (Console-> in "make menuconfig")
 - Set coreboot debug level to 0 instead of 8 (Console-> in "make menuconfig")
 - Changed GRUB timeout to 1 second instead of 2 (in grub.cfg
 - Removed background image in GRUB.
 - Removed memtest86+ payload (since it relies on serial output)

coreboot_serial.rom (slower boot speeds, debugging enabled):
 - Boot time still reduced, but only by ~2 seconds
 - has the memtest86+ payload included in the ROM
 - has serial port enabled. How this is achieved (from X60_source):
 - Turn on debugging level to 8, and enable serial output
(in Console-> in coreboot "make menuconfig")
(and build with grub_serial.cfg and grub_memdisk_serial.cfg)

Revision 1 (2014 March 9th):
 - recreated coreboot config from scratch
 - GRUB loads even faster now (less than 2 seconds).
 - Total boot time reduced by further ~5 seconds.
 - Added crypto and cryptodisk modules to GRUB
 - cbfstool now included in the binary archives

Revision 2 (2014 June 5th):
 - added backlight support (Fn+Home and Fn+End) on X60
 - fixed broken/unstable 3D when using kernel 3.12 or higher
(see "BACKPORT" file)

Revision 3 (2014 June 11th):
 - removed "CD" boot option from coreboot.rom (not needed)
 - removed "processor.max_cstate=2" and "idle=halt" options (see README.powertop file)

Revision 4 (2014 June 22nd)
 - updated GRUB (git 4b8b9135f1676924a8458da528d264bbc7bbb301, April 20th 2014)
 - Made "DeJavu Sans Mono" the default font in GRUB (fixes border corruption).
 - re-added background image in GRUB (meditating GNU)
 - added 6 more images: 
 * * coreboot_ukqwerty.rom (UK Qwerty keyboard layout in GRUB)
 * * coreboot_serial_ukqwerty.rom (UK Qwerty keyboard layout in GRUB)
 * * coreboot_dvorak.rom (US Dvorak keyboard layout in GRUB)
 * * coreboot_serial_dvorak.rom (US Dvorak keyboard layout in GRUB)
 * * coreboot_ukdvorak.rom (UK Dvorak keyboard layout in GRUB)
 * * coreboot_serial_ukdvorak.rom (UK Dvorak keyboard layout in GRUB)
 (coreboot.rom and coreboot_serial.rom have US Qwerty keyboard layout in GRUB, as usual)
 - improved the documentation:
 * * removed FLASH_INSTRUCTION and README.powertop and merged them with README
 * * removed obsolete info from README and tidied it up
 * * deleted README (replaced with docs/index.html)
 - tidied up the menu entries in GRUB
 - tidied up the root directory of X60_source/, sorted more files into subdirectories
 - added "pkg-config" to the list of dependencies for building powertop on Trisquel
 - wrote a script (powertop.trisquel6) to automatically setup Powertop to run at boot time (for Trisquel 6 users)
 - improved the commenting inside the 'build' script (should make modifying it easier)
 - Renamed X60_binary.tar.gz and X60_source.tar.gz to libreboot_bin.tar.gz and libreboot_src.tar.gz, respectively.
 - Replaced "GNU GRUB version" with "FREE AS IN FREEDOM" on GNU GRUB start screen.
 - Added sha512.txt files in libreboot_src and libreboot_bin. (inside the archives)
 - Added libreboot_bin.tar.gz.sha512.txt and libreboot_src.tar.gz.sha512.txt files (outside of the archives)

Revision (2014 June 22nd - extra)
 - Documentation: Improved the instructions for using flashrom
 - Documentation: Improved the instructions for using cbfstool (to change the default GRUB menu)
 - Documentation: Numerous small fixes.

Revision (2014 June 22nd - extra)
 - Documentation: added "X60 Unbricking tutorial
 - Documentation: added info about enabling or disabling wifi
 - Documentation: added info about enabling or disabling trackpoint

4th release.
2014 February 21st

Compiled version () (pre-compiled coreboot.rom, flashrom/bucts source code. Documentation.):
 - useful if you just want to flash the new version:
 - http://gluglug.org.uk/X60/release/3/X60_binary.tar.gz

Source code () (coreboot, bucts, flashrom, grub2, memtest86+. Config files. Documentation.):
 - useful if you want to study and hack the source code:
 - http://gluglug.org.uk/X60/release/3/X60_source.tar.gz

Changes:
 - Removed SeaBIOS (redundant)
 - New GRUB version (2.02~beta2)
 --> Fixes some USB issues
 --> Includes ISOLINUX/SYSLINUX parser
 - New grub.cfg
 --> Removed useless options:
 		* options for booting sda 2/3/4
		* seabios boot option
 - Added new menu entries:
 --> Parse ISOLINUX config (USB)
 --> Parse ISOLINUX config (CD)
 --> Added "cat" module for use on GRUB command line.
		* "set pager=1" is set in grub.cfg, for less-like functionality

The "Parse" options read ./isolinux/isolinux.cfg on a CD or USB,
and automatically converts it to a grub config and switches to the boot menu of that distro.
This makes booting ISO's *much* easier than before.
